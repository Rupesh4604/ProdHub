## Enhancing Existing Features

**Habit Tracker Streaks & Analytics:**

Streaks: Automatically calculate and display how many consecutive days a user has completed a habit. This is a huge motivator.

Visualizations: Add a simple calendar view to show habit consistency over the month.

**Project Notes & Resources:**

Add a dedicated "Notes" tab within each project where you can jot down ideas, store code snippets, or keep important information.

Allow users to add a list of relevant links (e.g., to documentation, articles, or tutorials) for each project.

**Sub-Tasks:**

Allow users to break down a large task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task could have its own checkbox, and completing all of them would complete the main task.

## New Major Features

**A Pomodoro Timer:**

Integrate a classic Pomodoro timer (25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of break) directly into the app. You could even link a timer session to a specific task to track how much focus time you're dedicating to it.

**Weekly Review & Summary:**

Create a "Weekly Review" page that automatically summarizes what you've accomplished: how many tasks you completed, which projects saw the most progress, and your habit consistency score.

## AI-Powered Enhancements

**AI-Powered Goal Decomposition:**

Instead of just generating tasks for an existing project, you could have an AI feature that helps you create the project itself. You could give it a high-level goal like "Learn web development" and it could suggest creating several projects (e.g., "Project 1: Build a Portfolio Website," "Project 2: Create a To-Do App") and then generate the tasks for each.

**AI Daily Planner:**

Add a button on the dashboard called "Plan My Day." The AI would look at your overdue tasks, high-priority tasks for today, and your synced calendar events, and then suggest a prioritized schedule for you to follow.

## User Experience Improvements

**Themes:**

Add a simple toggle in the settings to switch between the current dark theme and a new light theme.

**Drag-and-Drop Reordering:**

Allow users to manually reorder their tasks within a project by simply dragging and dropping them.
